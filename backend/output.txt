With him on the

*557 MR. ███████
███████
delivered the
opinion of the

"may prepay his
obliga ons under
this contract in full
at any me prior to
maturity of the
final instalment
here-under, and, if
he does so, shall
receive a rebate of
the unearned

por on of the
Finance Charge
computed under
the sum of the
digits method. . .
-" The face of the
contract also
stated that
temporary default
ona par cular
installment would
result ina
predetermined
*558 delinquency
charge. Not

men oned on the
disclosure page
was a clause in the
body of the
contract giving the
creditor a right to
accelerate
payment of the

en re debt upon
the buyer's
default. [1]
Respondents
subsequently
commenced ████
separate suits
against ████ in
the █████████████
██████████████ for
████████████ of
██████, alleging,
inter alia, that
████ had violated
████ and

Regula on Z by
failing to disclose
on the front page

████████████████████ agreed
with ████████████
█████ that ████
imposes a general
accelera on-clause
disclosure
requirement.[5]
Rather than res ng
on ████████████
█████'s holding
that accelera on is
a default charge,
however, the
█████ of Appeals
based its decision
on the narrower
principle that
under Regula on Z
"[t]he creditor
must disclose
whether a rebate
of unearned
interest will be
made upon
accelera on *559
and also disclose
the method by
which the amount
of unearned
interest will be
computed if the
debt is
accelerated." 588
F.2d 753, 757
(████), quo ng St.
Germain v. Bank
of Hawaii, ███
F.2d 572, 577 (CA9
████). See 12 CFR
§ 226.8 (b) (7)
(████). Implicit in
the conclusion of
the █████ of
Appeals and
explicit in its
preceding St.
Germain

decision was ███████████████
contrary

█████. The issue
for decision in this
case is whether
the Truth in
Lending Act (████),
82 Stat. 146, as
amended, 15 U.S.
C. § 1601 et seq.,
requires that the
existence of an
accelera on clause
always be
disclosed on the
face of a credit
agreement. The
████████████████Board staff has
consistently
construed the
statute and

regula ons as
imposing no such
uniform
requirement.
Because we
believe that a high
degree of
deference to this
administra ve
interpreta on is
warranted, we
hold that ████
does not mandate
a general rule of
disclosure for
accelera on
clauses. | The
several
respondents in
this case
purchased
automobiles from
various dealers,
financing their
purchases through
standard retail
installment
contracts that
were assigned to
█████████████████████████████

of the contract
that the creditor
retained the right
to accelerate
payment of the
debt.[2] In ███ of
the suits,[3] the
██████████████ held
that facial
disclosure of the
accelera on
clauses was
mandated by the
provision of ████
that compels
publica on of
"default,
delinquency, or
similar charges
payable in the
event of late
payments," 15
U.S. C. §§ 1638 (a)
(9), 1639 (a) (7).
